orthopoly-quadrature
====================

Orthopoly Quadrature is a collection of Cython scripts for computing
various types of orthogonal polynomials and quadrature rules. Most of
the codes are based on Walter Gautschi's OPQ Matlab suite for generating 
orthogonal polynomials and quadrature rules
